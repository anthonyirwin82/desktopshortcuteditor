# Desktop Shortcut Editor
Desktop Shortcut Editor makes it very easy to add, search and edit desktop entry files in desktop environments and application launchers that uses the free desktop entry file specification.


I consider this software complete with all the features that are needed for it's intended purpose. This means that you will not see regular updates as the software is fully functional and nothing further is needed at this time.

If you have issues with the software then please submit an [Issue](https://github.com/anthonyirwin82/desktopshortcuteditor/issues) so that the issue can be looked into.
